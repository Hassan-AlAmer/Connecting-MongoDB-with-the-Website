# Connecting MongoDB with the Website
### DESCRIPTION

## Project Objective:

As a Full Stack Developer, you have to create a database connection with MongoDB using ExpressJS.

## Background of the problem statement:

In this sprint, the scrum team has agreed to develop the backend functionality of the application using ExpressJS and MongoDB. Since you recently trained and worked on this framework, youâ€™re chosen to lead this project and complete the initial part of the application. You are asked to create a database to add, delete, update, and fetch courses from Simplilearn's database. You have agreed to complete this task as early as possible, as the release of the application is next week.

## You must use the following:

- **NodeJS:** To build JavaScript applications

- **MongoDB:** For database creation

- **Git:** To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub

- **GitHub:** To store your application

## Following requirements should be met:

- A part of the source code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. You need to document the tracked files that are ignored during the final push to the GitHub repository.

- The submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository in the document.

- The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented.
